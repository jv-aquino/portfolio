            <p>Stephen William Hawking (1942-2018) was a British theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and science communicator, internationally recognized for his contributions to science, and one of the most renowned scientists in history.</p>
            <p>His works include a theorem on the gravitational singularity and the theory that black holes emit radiation (Hawking Radiation), and his many world-famous books and lectures on science. He was the first scientist to establish a theory explained by the union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics - close to what is called the Theory of Everything.</p>
          <p>Despite all the difficulties caused by the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that accompanied him from a young age and resulted in the need for his wheelchair, Stephen continued to fight and work until the end of his life</p>
            <p>Stephen motivated me to pursue more scientific knowledge and was very important in a part of my life. Rest in peace.</p>
