# Portfolio of projects 💻
### This portfolio was created to follow my evolution as a web developer 📘. These projects are the reason for all my learning, and they have greatly improved my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, and I am extremely grateful to FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project for teaching me so much for free. 👨‍💻
### Below are the projects, listed based on the courses I have taken during my dev journey.
